## Topics

We invite submissions related to the following (non-exhaustive) topics that are related to optimal transport:

#### Optimal Transport Theory:
* OT with generalized choices of cost functions
* Study of partial differential equations and Wasserstein gradient flows (theory + applications)
* Limits of regularization schemes  

#### Generalizations of Optimal Transport:
* Unbalanced formulation (OT between measures of different mass)
* Gromov-Wasserstein formulation (OT with rigid transformations)
* Multi-marginal OT 
* Martingale OT (financial applications, etc)

#### Computational and Statistical Optimal Transport
* Estimation of Monge maps, couplings, etc.
* Finite-sample convergence guarantees
* Limit distribution theory 
* Study of complexity of OT algorithms

#### Optimal Transport as a Learning Methodology and Applications:
* OT costs as a loss (e.g. GANs, minimization of Wasserstein distance between empirical and population measures)
* OT to define data transformations (domain adaptation, clustering)
* High-dimensional applications such as Natural Language Processing, computational biology, vision tasks, etc.
* Low-dimensional applications such as graphics, shapes, imaging, etc.


## Important Dates

*   Submission Deadline: September 29th, 2023
*   Acceptance Notification: October 27th, 2023
