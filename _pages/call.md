## Topics

We invite submissions related to the following (non-exhaustive) topics that are related to optimal transport:

#### Estimation of optimal transport maps, couplings:
* Estimation of Monge maps using parameterized or constrained families of potentials
* OT with generalized choices of cost functions

#### Generalizations and extensions of optimal transport:
* Unbalanced formulation (OT between measures of different mass)
* Gromov-Wasserstein formulation (OT with rigid transformations)
* Multi-marginal OT 
* Martingal OT (financial applications, etc)

#### Statistics and theory
* Finite-sample convergence guarantees 
* OT as a convergence criterion for sampling
* Theoretical properties of OT (e.g. )
* Study of complexity of OT algorithms (e.g., Sinkhorn for entropic OT and related variants)
* Study of partial differential equations and Wasserstein gradient flows (theory + applications)

#### Optimal transport as a learning methodology and applications:
* OT costs as a loss (e.g. GANs, minimization of Wasserstein distance between empirical and population measures)
* OT to define data transformations (domain adaptation, clustering)
* Connections to diffusion models via Schr√∂dinger Bridges and entropic OT
* High-dimensional applications such as Natural Language Processing, computational biology, vision tasks, etc.
* Low-dimensional applications such as graphics, shapes, imaging, etc.


## Important Dates

*   Submission Deadline: September 29th, 2023

## Submission Details

To ensure your submission is considered, please adhere to the following guidelines:

*   **Formatting Instructions**: Use the following **[style files](/assets/files/neurips2023_otml.zip)** when preparing your submission. Use the following style files when preparing your submission. Papers need to be prepared and submitted as a single file: We accept *long (8 pages)* and *short (4 pages)*, with unlimited pages for references and appendix in both cases. The maximum size of submissions is 50 MB. While your submission can contain a supplement or appendix, please note that reviewers are not obliged to review supplementary material.
*   **Reviews**: The review process will be double-blind. All **submissions must be anonymized** and the leakage of any identification information is prohibited.

To submit your work, please visit the **[OpenReview submission website](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2023/Workshop/OTML)**. The list of accepted papers will be posted on the workshop website.
